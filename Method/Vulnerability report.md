# Vulnerability reporting

Make a list of vulnerabilities before exploring them.

You don't have to write a lot of information, but you can copy and paste from Nessus to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and it will include links automatically.

A report would also include solutions and proofs of concept.
